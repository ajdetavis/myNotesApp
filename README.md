# Notes App

The main purpose of this project was for me to practice Javascript. The only file that has my unique code is mainAssets/js/notes.js. All the rest is a template I borrowed from HTML5 UP. I made modifications to index.html as well to allow for easier manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript.




I borrowed the design, styles, and markup from HTML5 up. Their info is below.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
